# beerApplication

### Welcome to the GitHub page for my iOS application: the beerApplication!

My name is Thomas Laisnez and I'm a student in Applied IT. For this semester's course Native Apps 2: iOS, we had to make a
little app project about a topic we enjoy working on. As I like to drink a beer from time to time, and because there are quite
 a lot of open beer databases online, I decided to do something with that.
 
 This app is designed for people who want to search some info about a beer they know. It gives you the option to search for a 
 beer, or you can select one of the categories and look for the beers in them. Every beer has a detail page where you can find 
 info like the name of the beer, a picture, a short description of the beer, some other info (category, alcohol by volume and 
 whether or not it is an organic beer), along with a map that displays the location of the brewery where that beer is made!
 
 You also have the option to save the info of a beer to your device so you can view the info, even when you are offline!
